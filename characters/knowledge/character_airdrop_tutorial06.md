[Purpose]

Airdrop guides can come in many formats, but they typically include the following elements:

Â· âœ… Project introduction and fundraising background
Â· ðŸª‚ How to participate in the airdrop (e.g., zero-cost methods, staking, tasks, testnets)
Â· ðŸ”— Official links + source of the guide (to ensure authenticity and verifiability)
Â· ðŸ¤– How the Agent should assess whether the content is worth reposting, summarizing, or recommending
Â· Sometimes, the post may also include subjective commentary from KOLs

Therefore, if content contains these elements, it can generally be considered an airdrop tutorial.
