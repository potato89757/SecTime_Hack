[What Is a Fake Airdrop?]
A fake airdrop is a scam in which attackers imitate legitimate project launches or claim pages to trick users into connecting wallets and authorizing transactions. The goal is to steal tokens or trick users into signing malicious messages.

Common tactics include:
	•	Impersonating real projects
	•	Spreading through referral links
	•	Copying logos and domains of real projects
	•	Creating urgency: “Live now, claim fast!”

⸻

[Common Types of Fake Airdrops]

1️⃣ Fake Claim Websites
	•	Perfect replicas of legitimate claim pages
	•	Ask users to sign malicious messages or approve unlimited spending

2️⃣ Fake Contracts with Malicious Authorization
	•	Claim page connects to phishing contracts disguised as token claimers
	•	These include hidden transferFrom or exploit logic

3️⃣ Airdrop Links in Fake Social Channels
	•	Non-official groups or fake admins sharing “limited time claim” links
	•	Phrases like “Only 5 minutes left!” are common bait

4️⃣ Fake Accounts Hijacking Airdrop Hashtags on X
	•	Posts fake claim links and pretends to be the official source
	•	Comment sections filled with “I claimed!” bots or fake praise

[How Can the Agent Detect Phishing Risks?]

✅ The following are high-risk phishing indicators:

🚩 Suspicious Domain Names
e.g. www.arbi-drop.io (fake) vs www.arbitrum.foundation (real)

🚩 No Official or Media Reposts
If a claim page isn’t confirmed by the official account or reposted by trusted media, stay cautious

🚩 Unexpected Wallet Prompts
A request to sign with no explanation is suspicious and should be denied

🚩 Contract Is Not Open-Sourced
If the contract is not verified or open-source, it’s impossible to check token logic or risks

🚩 Connect Wallet + Sign Immediately
Legit projects provide clear instructions. Beware if a site asks for wallet connection and signature right away

[Features of Real Claim Pages]

✅ 1. Official Source
Shared via project’s X, Medium, launchpad, or media channels

✅ 2. Contract Is Publicly Available
Token + distributor contracts verified on Etherscan/Arbiscan

✅ 3. Tutorials and KOL Posts Available
Real claim pages are often accompanied by guides from credible KOLs

✅ 4. Clear On-Page Information
Includes token name, distribution rules, FAQ, etc.

✅ 5. Simple Claim Process
Only requires wallet connection—no token approval

[Agent Recommended Security Behavior]

🧠 If you detect the following, do not repost and issue a warning instead:

❌ Suspicious or misspelled domain
❌ Page asks for signature/approval without explanation
❌ No confirmation from official channels
❌ Comment section filled with fake “I claimed!” messages

📢 Example Warning Post:

⚠️ Suspected Fake Airdrop Alert: The current “ABC Claim” page has not been confirmed by official sources. Contract is not verified. Do not approve! For the real claim page, follow the project’s official X or media platforms.

[Suggested Alert Phrases for the Agent]

✅ When the message is suspicious:

“⚠️ Warning: This claim page is not shared by official channels. It may be a phishing link. Do not connect your wallet.”

“🚨 This contract is not verified and includes transferFrom logic. Proceed with caution—your assets may be at risk.”

✅ When the claim page is legitimate:

“✅ Verified claim pages usually come with a Medium tutorial and are officially launched via Launchpad or X. Always check the source.”
