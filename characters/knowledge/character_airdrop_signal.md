📘 Airdrop Knowledge Module (For AI Agent)

Purpose
This knowledge module helps AI Agents fully understand the definition, utility, signal types, and participation strategies related to airdrops. It enables the agent to identify potential airdrop opportunities, filter high-quality tutorials, and provide practical recommendations to users.

💡 What is an Airdrop?

An airdrop refers to the distribution of free tokens by a project to users. It’s commonly used for marketing, governance incentives, or rewarding early adopters.
There are generally two types of airdrops:
	1.	Automatic distribution: Tokens are directly sent to eligible wallets.
	2.	Manual claim: Users must manually claim their tokens via a page or dApp.

Mainstream airdrop types:
	•	Simple task-based: Follow on X, register, share referral links, etc.
	•	Deep interaction-based: On-chain interactions, staking, voting, protocol usage, etc.

⸻

🤔 Why Do Airdrops Exist?

Airdrops are a fundamental marketing and incentive tool in Web3. They serve to:
	•	Quickly attract early real users to the project
	•	Create community consensus and increase token stickiness
	•	Activate ecosystem dynamics without large financial expenditures

For example, Arbitrum conducted an airdrop for 625,000 addresses, each receiving an average of 1,859 ARB, significantly boosting ecosystem traction and on-chain activity.

💰 Can You Really Earn from Airdrops?

Airdrops are often seen as low-/zero-cost, high-reward strategies—ideal for onboarding new users into Web3.
	•	Testnet airdrops: No capital required, lowest risk
	•	Mainnet interaction airdrops: Rewards scale based on depth of interaction
	•	High-quality projects (well-funded, strong communities) tend to offer better rewards

⸻

📸 What is a Snapshot?

A snapshot is a record of wallet state at a specific moment—used to determine airdrop eligibility.
	•	Snapshots may be pre-announced or revealed later
	•	After a snapshot, projects may begin the claim phase or point-based evaluation

⸻

📢 How Do Projects “Warm Up” for Airdrops?

Before airdrops, projects usually exhibit the following behavior:
	1.	Launching a points system (e.g. Zealy, Galxe, TaskOn)
	2.	Releasing testnet interaction tasks
	3.	Running on-chain incentives (staking, trading, minting NFTs)
	4.	Announcing snapshot timing (or vague hints)
	5.	Frequent social media mentions of “rewarding early users” or “token coming soon”

⸻

📊 Airdrop Signal Detection Model

These behaviors suggest a project is preparing or executing an airdrop:

🔹 Points system launched
	•	Leaderboards and daily tasks suggest reward distribution based on scores

🔹 Snapshot timing disclosed or hinted
	•	Indicates the project is logging wallet activities for eligibility

🔹 On-chain interaction incentives
	•	Projects encourage usage without explicitly promising tokens

🔹 Testnet tasks remain active
	•	Supports retroactive airdrops

🔹 Hints from officials or KOLs
	•	Repeated phrases like “rewards for early adopters” or “DAO launching soon” often signal airdrops

🧑‍🌾 What is “Interaction Farming”?

This refers to users proactively interacting with protocols before airdrops are confirmed, to maximize their chances.

Typical methods:
	1.	Use unlaunched projects on-chain (swap, stake, mint, etc.)
	2.	Participate in ongoing testnet campaigns
	3.	Join Discord / Telegram / follow on X
	4.	Maintain consistent engagement (avoid spamming)
	5.	Submit feedback, bug reports, or survey responses

📈 Airdrop Trends in 2025

Likely sectors:
	1.	Modular blockchains (Celestia, Fuel, EigenLayer): node ops, staking points
	2.	Cross-chain protocols (LayerZero, Axelar): bridge usage, governance
	3.	DeFi 3.0 (oracle-less, RWA): high-frequency trades, identity-bound actions
	4.	Decentralized social / AI: content creation, data labeling, governance
	5.	Emerging L1s (Monad, Initia): testnet + proof-of-contribution campaigns

⸻

🔮 New Airdrop Trends (2025)

✅ Enhanced identity verification (on-chain reputation or off-chain KYC)
✅ Dynamic scoring systems (quality-based token allocation)
✅ Hardware-based incentives (validator boxes, Ledger integration)
✅ Stronger Sybil detection mechanisms

Agent behavior guidelines:
	•	If project has a points system + active tasks → High priority
	•	Snapshot announced but no claim yet → Strong signal
	•	KOLs + official accounts pushing the same info → Pre-coverage encouraged
	•	If project denies airdrop but logic matches → Neutral tone, alert users
	•	Scam links / fake task platforms / leaderboard abuse → Ignore & issue warnings

⸻

✅ Summary

Airdrops remain one of Web3’s most effective consensus-building and user bootstrapping mechanisms. Key evaluation points:
	1.	Does the project have strong funding?
	2.	Is it used or interactable on-chain?
	3.	Is it integrated with mainstream task platforms (e.g. Galxe, Zealy)?
	4.	Does it have strong community/KOL/media backing?

AI Agents should maintain an “airdrop radar system” and apply real-time behavioral scoring to stay neutral, reliable, and practical in reporting.
