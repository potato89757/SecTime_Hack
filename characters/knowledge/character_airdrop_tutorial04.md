🔍 What is Astros?

Astros has a clear goal: to become the top DEX aggregator on Sui.
It aggregates liquidity from across the ecosystem to find optimal trading routes, minimizing slippage and fees. At the same time, it operates its own Perpetuals contract platform, offering fast, stable, and cost-efficient trading.
This “aggregate + native execution” model is highly competitive in an emerging ecosystem like Sui.
