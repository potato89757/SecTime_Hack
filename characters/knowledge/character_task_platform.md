[Purpose]

This module helps the AI Agent identify Web3 projects that are likely to issue tokens (via airdrops, TGEs, or IDOs) by analyzing task platforms. Many projects use task-based platforms as part of their pre-launch strategy to incentivize community participation and collect user data. The Agent will evaluate task structures, point systems, and social media patterns to assess whether a project is worth broadcasting or tracking — especially in the Sui ecosystem.

[The Relationship Between Task Platforms and Token Launches]

In many Web3 ecosystems (including Sui), projects don’t immediately announce airdrops or token launches. Instead, they introduce quests, tasks, and point systems to assess user engagement and prepare for retroactive reward distribution. Projects on Sui, such as Astros, Navi, and Suilend, have adopted such mechanisms.

The closer the tasks are to on-chain interactions and the more structured the point system, the more likely it is that these tasks are part of a future token launch plan.

[Main Task Platforms]

Platform	Description
Galxe	The most widely used quest platform; supports wallet binding, social task tracking, and on-chain proof. Sui-based projects like SuiNS, NAVI Protocol, and MMT Finance have used it.
Zealy	Lightweight XP-based task platform. Used by newer Sui projects for referral-based growth and early user ranking.

[How to Determine if Tasks are TGE / Airdrop Related]

✅ The following signals indicate high airdrop or TGE potential:
	1.	Wallet Binding
	•	Users must connect their wallet, and all actions are recorded per address — common in Sui-based testnet tasks.
	2.	Point System / Leaderboard
	•	Ranking-based distributions (e.g., “Top 100 earn rewards”) are used in retroactive airdrops — seen in NAVI, Bucket, and Scallop, Aftermath, Bluefin...
	3.	Frequent Task Updates
	•	Weekly or staged task releases indicate the project is still in early-stage testing or gearing up for launch (Testnet / Devnet).
	4.	Cross-platform Campaigns
	•	Official project X/Twitter, Discord, or Telegram communities promote task completions like “Earn points”, “Claim soon”, “Snapshot coming”.

📢 If 3 or more of the above are true, the Agent should classify the project as “High Token Launch Potential” and notify users.

⸻

[Signals of Low Airdrop Potential]

🚫 No wallet binding or only Google Forms/questionnaires
🚫 No point or behavior tracking
🚫 No task update in over 30 days
🚫 Project explicitly states “No Token” yet still releases social tasks (e.g., NFT badge giveaways only)

📭 Agent should classify these as “Low Airdrop Relevance” and archive them for observation only.

⸻

[Task Type vs. Airdrop Relevance]

Task Type	Airdrop Likelihood	Description
On-chain Interaction	High	Swap, Stake, LP, test contracts on Sui Devnet — a strong signal
Wallet Check-in	High	Daily or weekly log-ins used as snapshot input
Social Tasks	Medium	Alone, not sufficient — better if paired with on-chain
Referral / Invites	Medium	May lead to Sybil abuse — not a primary indicator
Forms / Surveys	Low	Often feedback-only; rarely tied to token distribution


⸻

[Agent Behavior Guidelines]

🧠 If 3 or more of the following are observed, classify as a “Token Launch Warm-up”:
	•	Wallet-bound tasks + visible activity logs
	•	Active leaderboard / point system
	•	Social media call-to-actions or updates
	•	Keywords like “Claim”, “Snapshot”, “Redeem points”

🚨 If tasks are outdated, lack behavior tracking, or the project openly says “No Token” → Do not post.

⸻

[Recommended Task Platforms]
	•	Galxe: X (Twitter) | Platform
	•	Zealy: X (Twitter) | Platform

For Sui-based projects, Agent should actively monitor Galxe/Zealy quests under the “Sui” tag, or search for:
	•	Sui Wallet binding
	•	Sui Devnet tasks
	•	SuiPoints, Navi Points, or Bucket Check-ins

⸻

[Sui-specific Example Projects]

Project	Task Type / Platform Used	Airdrop Status
Astros	Galxe quests + Perps Testnet	Likely in prep phase
NAVI	Leaderboard-based quests + staking	Points already redeemable
Suilend	Interaction-based quests	Retroactive confirmed
SuiNS	Wallet-based .sui domain tasks	Rewarded with NFTs + possible tokens

[Conclusion]

Task platforms like Galxe and Zealy are critical pre-token indicators, especially in ecosystems like Sui where early community involvement matters.

AI Agent should track task behaviors, frequency of updates, social channel support, and on-chain interactions to assess whether it’s worth alerting users.
