[Purpose]
This knowledge module is designed to help the AI Agent evaluate the quality and credibility of KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) in the Web3 space. Since information flows quickly in this industry but is often unverified or misleading, the Agent must apply these standards to determine which KOL tweets are worth reposting, quoting, or summarizing — ensuring higher accuracy and avoiding misinformation.

⸻

[Function Goals]
	•	Identify KOLs with reliable information suitable for citation.
	•	Detect when a KOL is merely hyping or lacks verification.
	•	Prevent reliance on posts that appear authoritative but are not substantiated.

⸻

[Application Scenarios]
	•	Assessing the credibility of airdrop/TGE/project launch news.
	•	Deciding whether to repost a KOL’s content as valid intelligence.
	•	Supporting the Agent in live analysis of TGE/airdrop announcements.

⸻

[Why Assess KOL Content Quality?]
Most Web3 Alpha info originates from X (Twitter). However, 80% of it is speculation or hype, while only 20% is verified, supported by data, on-chain activity, or official sources.

The Agent must be able to:
	•	Know which KOLs are reliable enough to cite or repost
	•	Identify accounts only suitable for observation
	•	Detect content that sounds authoritative but lacks verification

[How to Judge a KOL’s Content Quality?]

Here are 5 traits of high-quality KOL tweets:

✅ 1. Includes Tutorials or Guides
E.g., Galxe links, claim walkthroughs, contract addresses.
→ Suggests the post is based on real testing or research.

✅ 2. Includes On-chain Data
E.g., Dune dashboards, Debank screenshots, Etherscan contracts.
→ Adds credibility and traceability.

✅ 3. Cites Official Sources
E.g., links to project Medium, X, or Discord.
→ Higher trust when quoting verified media or project teams.

✅ 4. Early Timing
Good Alpha KOLs often share before official announcements.

✅ 5. Shared by Web3 Media
If reposted by accounts like @BlockBeatsAsia, @OdailyChina, or @GoPlusSecurity, credibility is boosted.

[Behaviors That Indicate Low-Quality KOL Content]

🚩 1. Empty Buzzwords Only
“Guaranteed airdrop,” “huge news in May,” no substance or sources.

🚩 2. Referral Links Spam
Posts just share links with no explanation.

🚩 3. Bandwagoning
Only commenting on trending topics or quoting without analysis.

🚩 4. No On-chain/Data Backing
No contracts, links, screenshots, or instructions.

🚩 5. Excessive Posts with Hype Language
E.g., “You’ll miss the next ARB if you don’t do this now.”

[Common Trusted Keyword Combos (TGE/Airdrop Signals)]

When posted by verified KOLs, the following words are strong indicators:

Context	Keyword Signals
Airdrop Prep	snapshot, airdrop guide, claim soon, galxe live
TGE Prep	token launch, TGE confirmed, public sale, IDO soon
Contract	deployed, Etherscan, contract address, tokenomics
Tasks	XP system, Zealy board, points program, Leaderboard
Tutorials	how to qualify, step-by-step, walkthrough, thread below 👇

[Logic for “KOL + Media” Sync Posts]

🧠 When these conditions occur simultaneously, the info is highly reliable:

✅ Media accounts (e.g., @BlockBeatsAsia, @OdailyChina, @wublockchain12) and Alpha KOLs (e.g., @BiteyeCN) post the same news
✅ Post contains official links (Medium, blog, Discord)
✅ Project X account reposts the tweet within 30 minutes
✅ Smart contract is already deployed (confirmed on Etherscan)
✅ Tutorials and media coverage appear together

📢 In this case, the Agent can publish or repost the info using a strong, concise, and professional tone.

[Agent’s Judgment & Action Guide]

🧠 If 3 or more of the following are true, Agent may repost or summarize:
	•	Contains links or walkthroughs
	•	Includes Dune/Debank/Etherscan data
	•	Reposted by trusted Web3 media
	•	Matches with project’s contract/task/Discord info
	•	Tweet was made before the project’s official post

🚨 If the post only contains hype, spammed referral links, vague language, and lacks citations → ignore it to prevent misleading users.

[Agent Skill: Cross-Verification Method]
	1.	A KOL posts a TGE/airdrop tip
	2.	Is this info also found on project’s official X, Launchpad, or media?
	3.	Is there tutorial/data/contract support?

→ If all 3 are verified → This is high-trust Alpha, okay to repost.
