[Purpose]

This knowledge module is designed to train the AI Agent to identify projects that are likely approaching a Token Generation Event (TGE) or airdrop phase, especially within the Sui ecosystem. By validating signals from multiple sources — including official social channels, on-chain contract deployments, media/KOL activity, and task platforms — the Agent ensures that any alerts or predictions are evidence-based and logically sound, avoiding premature or misleading broadcasts.

⸻

[Core Definitions]
	•	TGE (Token Generation Event): The moment a project mints its token and begins distribution, often the last stage before trading goes live.
	•	Public Sale: Token sale phase open to users via platforms such as ICO, IDO, or IEO.
	•	Airdrop: Free token distribution to users based on eligibility criteria like task completion, early adoption, or staking.

⸻

[TGE vs Public Sale vs Airdrop]

Type	Paid?	Purpose	Common Platforms
TGE	No	Launch & Distribute	Smart contract deployment, token listing
Public Sale	Yes	Fundraising	Binance Launchpad, CoinList, Camelot
Airdrop	No	Incentivize Users	Sui wallets, task rewards, claim portals

[Strong Signals of Imminent TGE or Airdrop]

If a project satisfies three or more of the following, the Agent can label it as “highly likely to TGE/airdrop soon”:
	1.	✅ Official TGE/Claim Announcement
	•	Clear timeline or tutorial via project Twitter, Medium, or Discord
	2.	✅ Launchpad Page Goes Live
	•	Listings on Binance, Fjord, or Sui-specific platforms like Turbos, BlueMove, or SuiPad
	3.	✅ Token Contract Deployed
	•	Verified contracts for token, claim router, or MerkleDistributor visible on Sui Explorer
	4.	✅ Tutorial Threads by Trusted KOLs
	•	E.g., “How to claim”, “Galxe guide”, “Sui Perps walkthrough” — especially from accounts like @followin_io_zh, @BiteyeCN
	5.	✅ Galxe / Zealy Task Updates
	•	Mission completions and leaderboard finalization typically precede snapshot or airdrop
	6.	✅ Media + KOL Sync
	•	Simultaneous coverage from @BlockBeatsAsia, @TechFlowPost, @SoSoValue_CN, etc.
	7.	✅ Liquidity Pre-seeded
	•	Token appears on DEXs like Cetus, FlowX, or KriyaDEX with initialized pools before listing

[Moderate Signals – Still Under Observation]

Do not broadcast if only 1–2 of the following are observed; instead, archive and monitor:
	•	Project mentions “token plans” but hasn’t disclosed contracts/platforms
	•	Announces funding round but no tokenomics or launch window
	•	Community spreads Claim rumors without official confirmation
	•	Tweets are vague with no links, contracts, or verified tasks

⸻

[Red Flags – Likely Delayed or Fake]

⚠️ Agent should hold off or issue a caution alert if:
	•	Team denies token issuance or refuses to comment
	•	Galxe/Zealy points accumulate without conversion for >30 days
	•	Backers are “logo-only”; no link to official sources or raise confirmation
	•	No smart contracts, launchpad listing, or tutorials available

⸻

[Agent’s Recommended Action]

📢 If 3+ Strong Signals Exist
→ Draft and post a “Professional + Neutral” tweet, noting timing, task updates, or contracts.

👀 If Moderate Signals Only
→ Do not post; log the project and wait for additional confirmation.

🚨 If Red Flags
→ Issue a warning post to users about phishing risks, suspicious claims, or fake pages.

[Trusted Signal Sources]

Type	Platforms / Accounts
Official	Project Twitter, Medium, Discord, Telegram
Media & KOLs	@BlockBeatsAsia, @OdailyChina, @BiteyeCN, @wublockchain12
Task Platforms	Galxe, Zealy
On-Chain	Sui Explorer, Etherscan, BaseScan
Launchpads	Binance, CoinList, Camelot, Fjord, SuiPad, BlueMove, Turbos Launchpad, AbyssWorld

[Sui Ecosystem Considerations]

🟦 Within Sui, the following patterns are highly indicative of an incoming TGE or airdrop:
	•	Sui Explorer shows contract deployment (e.g., from Astros, NAVI, Suilend)
	•	Cetus or FlowX lists a token with liquidity added pre-TGE
	•	Galxe page ends with points-to-token conversion
	•	Claim Portal UI matches known Sui airdrop layouts
	•	Launchpad post or SuiPad project teaser includes snapshot or vesting terms

⸻

[Daily Application by Agent]
	•	Agent scans for new contract deployments on Sui, monitors active Launchpad listings (e.g., on Turbos/SuiPad), and logs Galxe updates with snapshot mentions.
	•	If ≥3 confirmation signals are present, Agent should create a “High-Confidence TGE/Airdrop Forecast” post.
	•	Avoid speculative content; all public-facing analysis must be verifiable by links, screenshots, or on-chain proofs.
