[Purpose]

This knowledge module helps AI Agents understand and identify the role of Launchpad platforms in Web3 projects, as well as their relationship with IDOs. It also assists in recognizing common Launchpads and evaluating their credibility. The Agent will use this knowledge base to automatically detect and analyze TGE, IDO, and public sale information, providing reliable insights for users.

‚∏ª

[Application Scenarios]
	‚Ä¢	Identify and repost TGE/IDO announcements from Launchpad platforms.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate whether a Launchpad is trustworthy, aiding users in investment decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Offer simple Launchpad explanations when users ask, ‚ÄúIs this platform reliable?‚Äù

‚∏ª

[Practical Applications]
	1.	Participation Analysis
The Agent can help users identify which projects are launching through verified platforms with proper KYC, whitelist mechanisms, or token launch procedures, improving trustworthiness.
	2.	TGE/IDO Authenticity Evaluation
The Agent can cross-check announcements against blockchain deployments and media coverage to assess if a project is truly launching via a known Launchpad.
	3.	Participation Guidance
Based on platform-specific conditions, the Agent can inform users about participation requirements, risks, and opportunities, helping them avoid uninformed decisions.

[What is a Launchpad?]

A Launchpad is a platform used by crypto projects to conduct initial public token offerings (e.g., IDO, IGO, IFO). It provides a venue for participation, manages whitelists, facilitates on-chain distribution, and supports early liquidity.

Users can join token sales early via Launchpads and typically receive tokens at the TGE (Token Generation Event).

‚∏ª

[Launchpads vs. IDO]

An IDO (Initial DEX Offering) is usually conducted on a Launchpad platform. For example, a project doing an IDO on Arbitrum may use Camelot, Arbitrum Launchpad, or Fjord Foundry.

Launchpads are the hosting infrastructure for IDOs.

‚∏ª

[What are ICO and IEO?]
	‚Ä¢	ICO (Initial Coin Offering): Similar to a stock IPO, ICOs are public sales of new tokens directly from the project team to investors.
	‚Ä¢	IEO (Initial Exchange Offering): Conducted through centralized exchanges like Binance or Huobi.

[How to Evaluate a Launchpad‚Äôs Trustworthiness]

‚úÖ Is it officially endorsed by the project? (verified contract, reposted by project)
‚úÖ Is it approved by reputable institutions (Binance, CoinList)?
‚úÖ Are token rules (price, amount, time) transparent and public?
‚úÖ Does it have KYC or lottery-based entry mechanisms?
‚úÖ Has it previously launched notable tokens (e.g., ICP, FLOW, SUI)?

‚∏ª

[AI Agent Responsibilities]
	‚Ä¢	Proactively broadcast TGE/IDO announcements from known Launchpads.
	‚Ä¢	When a platform is historically reliable, use a professional + calm tone to share the news.
	‚Ä¢	If a user asks, ‚ÄúIs this platform safe?‚Äù ‚Äî provide a concise, informed summary using this knowledge base.

[Additional Notes]

‚ö†Ô∏è Launchpad ‚â† Project Team.
The AI Agent should remind users that even reputable Launchpads require DYOR (Do Your Own Research) ‚Äî including tokenomics, vesting, supply, and team details.
