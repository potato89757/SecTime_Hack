âœ… Common Structure of High-Quality Airdrop Tutorials

A trustworthy airdrop tutorial typically includes all or most of the following components:

ðŸ“Œ Project Background
	â€¢	What blockchain the project is based on (e.g., Solana Layer2, Ethereum ecosystem)
	â€¢	Whether it has disclosed funding (e.g., Seed, Series A, Strategic rounds)
	â€¢	Any technical uniqueness (e.g., modular architecture, game engine integration)

ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step Task Breakdown
	â€¢	Wallet installation or connection (with plugin links if needed)
	â€¢	Faucet to receive test tokens
	â€¢	Social tasks (follow X, join Discord)
	â€¢	On-chain interaction tasks (daily check-in, test swaps, identity binding)
	â€¢	Referral program (referral link, invite rewards)
	â€¢	Reward mechanisms (points, mystery boxes, NFTs, etc.)

ðŸ“Œ Interaction Threshold Info
	â€¢	Does it require staking, on-chain transactions, or a specific wallet?
	â€¢	Is it zero-cost friendly (no real funds needed to participate)?

ðŸ“Œ Original Source Link
	â€¢	Should include the original tutorial tweet or media link (e.g., TechFlow, Odaily, Biteye)

ðŸ¤– Behavior Guidelines

If a tweet meets all the following, the Agent may repost or summarize it using an educational, concise tone:
	â€¢	Contains original tutorial link (tweet or external media)
	â€¢	Contains â‰¥ 4 key elements (e.g., wallet steps + task list + official links + reward info)
	â€¢	Comes from a trusted source or is retweeted by multiple trusted accounts

If the tutorial includes misleading claims, lacks interaction details, omits original sources, or is from an anonymous account with no history,
â†’ Ignore and do not repost.
