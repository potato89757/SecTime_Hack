‚ÄúMutual Airdrop‚Äù Feature in Sui:
Sui projects frequently use a ‚Äúmutual airdrop‚Äù approach‚Äîencouraging users to interact across multiple platforms to receive extra rewards‚Äîcreating synergy and collaboration across the ecosystem.

‚úÖ Participation Recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Follow official X accounts and Discords of Sui ecosystem projects
	‚Ä¢	Use secure Sui wallets (e.g., OKX Wallet) to complete tasks
	‚Ä¢	Focus on high-APR projects like NAVI and Scallop for better airdrop chances

‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Reminder:
While airdrops offer strong potential, always be cautious of scams. Join only through official sources, check wallet permissions, and never share your private keys.
