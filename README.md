## 1. Background: Opportunities Lost in an Information Deluge

The Sui mainnet is expanding at high speed. TGEs, aidrops, and new projects emerge almost daily, yet:
- Signal-to-noise is low : valuable updates drown in social-media chatter.
- Users struggle to react in time and routinely miss Alpha or airdrop windows.

## 2. Inspiration: Let a Dog ‚ÄúSniff Out‚Äù Your Alpha
‚ÄúWhat if a dog could fetch only the juiciest intel for you?‚Äù 

Enter **SuiBobi** ‚Äî

- An AI Twitter bot powered by ElizaOS.
- Monitors Sui on-chain data & social feeds 24/7, auto-filters high-value info.
- Personified as a clever border collie in swim goggles that dives into the data ocean and resurfaces with the tastiest bones (Alpha). 

## 3. Three Stand-Out Features of SuiBobi
| Feature | Benefit | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
|Full-Scope Monitoring | Captures real-time TGEs, airdrops, hack alerts| Multi-source parsing via ElizaOS |
|Auto Summaries | Distills key points, prevents info overload | ‚ÄúThree retweets ‚Üí one summary‚Äù cadence |
Humanized Meme Presence | Border-collie avatar + meme culture | Boosts engagement and reach |

## 4. $BOBI: Giving a Meme Coin Real Purpose

Beyond intel, SuiBobi issues **$BOBI**:
- The token powers ecosystem incentives and community governance.
- Embraces meme culture to drive viral growth.
- Detailed tokenomics will appear in an upcoming white-paper. 

[**Token Info**](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0x7a9f79c826a1b21f7ada3ec14c7de16ec4ac3eb46aaed9e7e3e20eff87a33d4b/fields):
- Total Supply: 233 million (inspired by the total amount stolen in the Cetus hack)
- Decimal Places: 7 (a nod to the remaining protected funds during the Cetus exploit)
- Future Issuance Plan: IDO
- As a meme coin, the majority of tokens will be redistributed to the community.

## 5. Tech
- Tech Stack: TypeScript ÔΩú Eliza v0.25.9 ü§ñ
